## Usage

```js
const releaseNotes = require("@semantic-release/release-notes-generator")

releaseNotes({}, (error, changelogs) {

})
```

## How it works

`release-notes-generator` is using [conventional-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog) with the Angular preset to parse commit messages and the `package.json` file in order to calculate the changelogs for a new release.
